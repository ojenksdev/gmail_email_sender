# gmail_email_sender
Python Script to send emails with attachments via command line. In order to use it simply add whatever attachment you want to send to the same directory as this script. 

NOTES: 
If using a Mac, make sure you've run the Install Certificates.command file (just search for it with finder).
If you don't, you could get this SSL error message. Looks like its a bug from Python 3.6 (at least that's what I read on Stackoverflow)

There is an error.txt file that gets created if for some reason connecting to the Gmail server fails. That file will be in the same directory as the script.
Check that out first to see if the issue is related to gmail or something else. 

***ALSO This Probably won't work if your gmail account is using additional security(2FA, etc.)***

Any issues, feel free to reach out directly at ojenksdev@gmail.com


Thanks!
